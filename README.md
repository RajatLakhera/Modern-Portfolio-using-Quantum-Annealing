# Modern-Portfolio-using-Quantum-Annealing

This project was made as an assignment for the Advance Quantum Computing training by Qulabs. 
The problem statements were:

1. Select best three stocks from given five using QUBO matrix and Quantum Annealing.
2. Use MPT to calculate optimum weights of these five stocks. 
3. Build QUBO matrix to get optimum weights and encode these weights. Then solve it using Quantum Annealer.
